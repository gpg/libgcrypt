%%name: Libgcrypt

%%short-description: Cryptographic library

%%full-description: This is a general purpose cryptographic library
based on the code from GnuPG.  It provides functions for all
cryptograhic building blocks: symmetric ciphers
(AES,DES,Blowfish,CAST5,Twofish,Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD5,
